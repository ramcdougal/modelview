ModelView on ModelDB: creating and running:

To install Robert's modelview:

To create modelview folder sign into indexer.med.yale.internal.
1) Run the below after cd'ing to the file shared ModelDB script folder:

hg clone https://tom_morse@bitbucket.org/ramcdougal/modelview

it will create the modelview folder among the other files and folders
in the modeldb home folder.

Run the same command
hg clone https://tom_morse@bitbucket.org/ramcdougal/modelview
in my home folder.  This will provide a place for the below mentioned sprinkle_json_gen.py
to take a copy of the json_gnerator.py to sprinkle into each of the expanded modeldb models

2) Robert will tell me how to get the neuronweb folder.  For now I
just copied it from the working tmp folder that we prototyped
modelview in.

3) Download the nrntest repository from 
hg clone http://www.neuron.yale.edu/hg/nrntest
into the /home/tmm46 folder (doesn't need to be on modeldb)

The process involves

a) downloading the neuron code

cd /home/tmm46/nrntest/verify
(note there is a README here that explains how to run the nrn tester)
./senselabmodels.py

b) compiling the mod files
it's necessary to set export variables for example
export mdbtest=7.4
export standard=7.4
mkdir /home/tmm46/nrntest/verify/7.4
(and then you can run this command in the verify folder
sh verify.sh
(or ./verify.sh)

3) moving the json_generator into the model's top level folders and running
python json_gnerator.py accessionid:

This is done by 

First starting screen so that one can detach (ctrl-A, D) and reattach latter: type
"screen" and enter on the command line.  Secondly start vnc by entering "vncserver" on the command line.
Thirdly inform the shell to send X11 to the vncserver by typing
export DISPLAY="whatever_the_vncserver_program_said_was_display:was_number"
Finally:
cd'ing to ~/nrntest/verify and running
python sprinkle_json_gen.py
(wait some number of hours)

If it is desired to regenerate the accessionnum.json files then delete them all before hand:
rm /home/tmm46/nrntest/verify/7.4/*/*/*.json
(each of their existence prevents the sprinkle_json_gen.py script from creating them again on a model by model basis)

5) copying the accessionnum.json file into the 
modelview/modelview.html
folder

this can be done by typing the below in the nrntest/verify folder

cp 7.4/*/*/*json ~/senselab/Senselab/Web/ModelDB/modelview

(then the model visualizer is available in the browser with a url
senselab/modeldb/modelview/modelview.html#accessionnum)

7) setting the has_modelview true by editing the model which will then
activate the link to modelview (the updated showmodel.asp page contains
the proper link)
